# DaintyDesignzStore

## Purpose: 
The purpose of this site is to combine what I've learned about the MERN stack into an ecommerce project.
A work in progress, this store will ultimately have user authentication, a fully functional checkout process with Paypal, and admin screens.

## Built with: 
React, React-Bootstrap, MongoDB, Express, Node, and Axios

## Demo: ![](frontend/public/images/daintyGIF.gif)
